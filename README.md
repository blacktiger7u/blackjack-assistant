# AI Poker / Blackjack Assistant
Overview A lightweight Python assistant that helps with blackjack decisions. Provide your hand and the dealer’s upcard, and the tool estimates bust probability for the next hit and recommends HIT or STAND. Future plans include OCR screen scanning and an on-screen overlay for live games.

Minimal CLI with clear stats.
## Installation (Windows)

## Usage

Enter your cards (e.g., K 5 A) and the dealer’s upcard (e.g., 7).
Read bust probability and HIT/STAND advice.
## Status
Work in progress. Core analysis is functional; OCR and overlay are planned.
